### Assignment Tests (30 / 30)

#### Work in the "C" Range

+ :heavy_check_mark:  5 / _5_ :  The correct current transformation matrix is used for drawing each bone

+ :heavy_check_mark:  5 / _5_ :  The child_root_transform is correctly set before the recursive call at the end of the function.

#### Work in the "B" Range

+ :heavy_check_mark:  4 / _4_ :  Draw at least a stick fgure (e.g., line segment or cylinder) representation for the each bone

+ :heavy_check_mark:  4 / _4_ :  Four additional special motions are defined, loaded, trimmed, and then played.

+ :heavy_check_mark:  2 / _2_ :  Motions smoothly transition from the ballet dancerâ€™s base loop motion into all of these special motions whenever a new motion is played.

#### Work in the "A" Range

+ :heavy_check_mark:  4 / _4_ :  QuickShapes are used to draw simple geometries like spheres, cubes, cylinders, cones, etc..

+ :heavy_check_mark:  3 / _3_ :  Transformation matrices (Matrix4s) are used to apply scales, translations, and rotations to the model matrix.

+ :heavy_check_mark:  3 / _3_ :  Colors and several geometries are used to make a convincing character.
