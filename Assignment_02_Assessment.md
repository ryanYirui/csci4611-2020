+ :heavy_check_mark:  _1_ / _2_ :  Launch the ball in the air based on a random initial velocity with space bar.

    The ball launches to a certain angle only.

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _3_ / _3_ :  Update the ballâ€™s position and velocity with gravity each time step.

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _3_ / _3_ :  The ball should bounce off the ground.

    


#### Work in the "B" Range

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _3_ / _3_ :  The ball bounces off the walls and ceiling.

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _4_ / _4_ :  The car does not leave the bounds of the playing area.

#### Work in the "A" Range

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _2_ / _2_ :  The ball collides with the car with the correct collision normal.

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _3_ / _3_ :  The ball should incorporate the velocity of the car when hit.

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _3_ / _3_ :  The car has a realistic driving model.
