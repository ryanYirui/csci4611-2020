# My solution to Assignment 2
CSCI4611 project 2: carsoccer  


This assignment is about a car and a ball playing soccer field. I did this project by the 3d graphing tools and cmake. The goal of the program is
to use the car to hit the ball in order to scroce.


command that I used for compiling:
go to repo/build and make by the tool cmake and then running the command  ./a2-carsoccer to visualize the actual program


car's motion is controled by key up, key down, key left, and key right  and everthing will be reset once score the ball into a goal, no matter which side of the scoring .
the ball start at the center of the pitch , and the direction of the ball will following the position that being hit by the ball and will be reset every time it scoring.

I did follow the requirement for the motion of the ball and the car.
