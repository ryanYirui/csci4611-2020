Art Render
for this assignment , I strictly followed the instructions and sources in the a5-handout and in the lecture.

The program is to represent several shading models of different object that given in the support
code and there are three models that user can choose.
below is the formulate that I followed
color = ka*Ia + kd*Id*diffuse + ks*Is*specular

diffuse = n · l

specular = (n · h) ^ s
